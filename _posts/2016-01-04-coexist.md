Spack installs every unique package/dependency configuration into its own
prefix, so new installs will not break existing ones.

Spack avoids library misconfiguration by using `RPATH` to link dependencies.
When a user links a library or runs a program, it is tied to the dependencies
it was built with, so there is no need to manipulate `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` at
runtime.
