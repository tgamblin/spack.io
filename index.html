  Spack is a package manager for
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer">supercomputers</a>,
  Linux, and macOS. It makes installing scientific software easy. With Spack,
  you can build a package with multiple versions, configurations, platforms, and
  compilers, and all of these builds can coexist on the same machine.

<p>
  Spack isn't tied to a particular language; you can build a software stack in
  <a href="https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html#extensions-python-support">Python</a>
  or R, link to libraries written in C, C++, or Fortran, and easily
  <a href="https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#compiler-configuration">swap compilers</a>.
  Use Spack to install in your home directory, to
  <a href="https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module_file_support.html">manage
  shared installations and modules</a> on a cluster, or
  to <a href="https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html#specs-dependencies">build
  combinatorial versions</a> of software for testing.
